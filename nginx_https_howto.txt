You can configure the NGINX server on the VM to act as an https proxy for the flask app. It listens to :5001 ssl and
internally redirects the traffic to :5000 internal. Following the configuration in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

server {
        listen 5001 ssl;
        listen [::]:5001 ssl ipv6only=on;
        server_name www.dafne.network;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.dafne.network/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.dafne.network/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                # New configs below
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                # Makes flask redirects use https, not http.
                proxy_redirect http://$http_host/ https://$http_host/;
        }
}

Remember to open the external firewall to tcp:5001 !
